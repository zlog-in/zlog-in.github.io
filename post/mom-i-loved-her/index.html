    <p>S5E3 of Rick and Mory, the story about how a boy grows up.</p>
<p>Morty doesn&rsquo;t like adventures, he did because Rick needs him.</p>
<p>Morty experienced a lot during his adventuring with Rick.</p>
<p>Morty has feelings but no body knows, or no body noticed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. <br>
My whole life, I&rsquo;ve never fit in anywhere. <br>
Everything I have to say is always met with an eye roll as if the act of hearing what I have to say is some exhausting chore. <br>
Nobody in this family thinks I can say or do anything right! <br>
I&rsquo;ve been all over the universe, met hundreds of people, and Planetina&rsquo;s the only one I&rsquo;ve ever met that makes me feel like I belong, and you just kicked her out of our house!<br>
I will never forgive you for this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song in ending of this episode is I am the Antichrist to you by Kishi Bashi.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who are you? Who am I to you?<br>
I am the antichrist to you<br>
Fallen from the sky with grace<br>
Into your arms race</p>
<p>Lucid lovers me and you<br>
A deal of matchless value<br>
I was always quick to admit defeat<br>
Empty statements of bones and meat<br>
And my heart it shook with fear<br>
I&rsquo;m a coward behind a shield and spear<br>
Take this sword and throw it far<br>
Let it shine under the morning star</p>
<p>Who are you? Who am I to you?<br>
I am the antichrist to you<br>
Fallen from the sky with grace<br>
Into your arms race</p>
<p>One for my heart and two for show<br>
Three tears for all the souls below<br>
One day we made them into figurines<br>
Burned them all with all my favorite things</p>
<p>Who are you? Who am I to you?<br>
I am the antichrist to you<br>
Fallen from the sky with grace<br>
Into your arms race<br>
Who are you? Who am I to you?<br>
I am the antichrist to you<br>
Fallen from the sky with grace<br>
Into your arms&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Morty grew up when he lost his love</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She&rsquo;s gone, Mom! She&rsquo;s gone! <br>
I loved her so much.</p>
